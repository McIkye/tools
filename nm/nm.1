.Sh NAME
.Nm nm
.Nd display name list (symbol table)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nm
.Op Fl aCegnoprsuVw
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The symbol table (name list) of each object in
.Ar file(s)
is displayed.
If a library (archive) is given,
.Nm
displays a list for each
object archive member.
If
.Ar file
is not present,
.Nm
searches for the file
.Pa a.out
and displays its symbol table if it exists.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.
.It Fl C
Decode low-level symbol names.
This involves removing extra underscores and making C++ function names readable.
.It Fl e
Output extended information, that is `w' for weak symbols, `f' for
function-like symbols, and `o' for object-like symbols.
.It Fl g
Restrict display to external (global) symbols.
.It Fl n
Present results in numerical order.
.It Fl o
Display full path or library name of object on every line.
.It Fl p
Do not sort at all.
.It Fl r
Reverse order sort.
.It Fl s
Show archive index.
.It Fl u
Display undefined symbols only.
.It Fl V
Show program version.
.It Fl w
Warn about non-object archive members.
Normally,
.Nm nm
will silently ignore all archive members which are not
object files.
.El
.Pp
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol
is undefined) and one of the following letters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Fl
debugger symbol table entries (see the
.Fl a
option)
.It Li A
absolute
.It Li B
bss segment symbol
.It Li C
common symbol
.It Li D
data segment symbol
.It Li I
indirect reference (alias to other symbol)
.It Li F
file name
.It Li R
read-only data segment symbol
.It Li T
text segment symbol
.It Li U
undefined
.It Li W
weak symbol (only on ELF binaries)
.El
.Pp
If the symbol is local (non-external), the type letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically.
