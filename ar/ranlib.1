.Sh NAME
.Nm ranlib
.Nd table-of-contents for archive libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ranlib
.Op Fl t
.Ar file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ranlib
creates an index of external references for archive libraries,
normally used by the loader,
.Xr ld 1 .
This index file is named
.Dq /
or
.Dq __.SYMDEF
and is prepended to the archive.
Files in the archive which are not executable and symbols which are
uninteresting to the loader are ignored.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl t
Set the modification time of the index file.
This time is compared by the loader with the modification time of the
archive to verify that the table is up-to-date with respect to the
archive.
If the modification time has been changed without any change to the
archive (for example, by a
.Xr cp 1 ) ,
the
.Fl t
option can be used to
.Dq touch
the modification time so that it appears that the table is up-to-date.
This is also useful after using the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr make 1 .
